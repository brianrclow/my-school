A basic NativeScript Application that displays courses I took at Boise State in a master-detail view.

There is the main list view with the course names and you can click on a course to view a more detailed description of the course pulled from the course catalog. 

## How to run the app:

1. npm install (possibly also ns install)
2. Run "tns run ios" from root

This will open your default ios simulator with the app running on it. To specify the device to run on:
"tns device ios --available-devices" to get the device you want. Then run: 
"tns run ios --device <device_id_that_you_found>"

Here are a few screenshots of what the app looks like!
